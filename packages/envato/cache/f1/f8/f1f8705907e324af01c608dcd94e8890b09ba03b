It has a beautiful newspaper style homepage layout that you can edit with drag and drop page editor. There are multiple different types of homepage content blocks that can be used and combined in different setups to achieve the perfect layout for you site. Magellan has 6 different demo sites that display different layouts and color styles &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/planetshine.net\/demo\/magellan\/news\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>News<\/strong><\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/planetshine.net\/demo\/magellan\/tech\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Tech<\/strong><\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/planetshine.net\/demo\/magellan\/gaming\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Gaming<\/strong><\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/planetshine.net\/demo\/magellan\/lifestyle\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Lifestyle<\/strong><\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/planetshine.net\/demo\/magellan\/fitness\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Fitness<\/strong><\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/planetshine.net\/demo\/magellan\/church\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Church<\/strong><\/a>. Each of these demos can be imported with a single click!\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\nMagellan&#8217;s simple news paper like homepage layout is easy to navigate and features a lot of attention grabbing headlines and images. Many images have unique frosted glass design image overlays, that add a semi opaque layer on top of the image. There are also features that allow you to place gradients on images that allow you to easily give the whole site a unified look and feel. The design for blog posts is clean and minimal to avoid distracting the reader.\n<h2 id=\"item-description__supercharge-your-review-site\">Supercharge your Review Site<\/h2>\nMagellan is the perfect theme for review sites. Every post can easily be turned into a review for any kind of product &#8211; latest gadget, fashion clothing, travel destination, computer game or even sports equipment. All you have to do to get started is open the post edit page in your WordPress admin and set the star rating value. This rating will now show up on the thumbnail for this post in homepage, blog article archive, search results etc.\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\nAnother cool thing that&#8217;s unique to Magellan is the Review summary tool. The theme has a specially made custom Visual Composer block that allows you to list all the pros and cons for the product and rate each of the aspects separately. These ratings will be animated the moment this block enters users viewport.\n<h2 id=\"item-description__create-video-news\">Create Video News<\/h2>\nIt&#8217;s very easy to embed a video in your posts and reviews. Just provide a link to the YouTube or Vimeo video you would like to embed and it will be shown in the place of post thumbnail. It&#8217;s also possible to set the videos to autoplay immidiately after opening the post.\n<h2 id=\"item-description__monetise-traffic-with-magellan-ads-system\">Monetise traffic with Magellan Ads System<\/h2>\nMagellan has extensive features that allow you to insert advertisements in header, sidebars, posts and various other places in the theme. The theme supports different types of ads in multiple sizes. It&#8217;s easier than ever to set up Google Adsense ads or to embed an iframe banner for an affiliate partner. Other advertisement networks are also supported &#8211; the theme allows you to insert any ad network script and display it on front end. You can also use regular image banners that can be linked anywhere &#8211; this can be useful for advertising products sold right there in your site (using WooCommerce e-commerce software).\nThe ad management system is simple but quite powerful. You can enable\/disable individual ads and their locations with a singe click. Adding and rotating multiple ads is just a matter of checking couple of checkboxes. It&#8217;s also super simple to add new advertisements or remove old ads. Magellan supports the most popular ad sizes and allows besides the predefined locations like header, gallery, below posts etc. you also have access to ad widgets and visual composer blocks for adding ads to posts.\n<h2 id=\"item-description__powefull-integrations-with-buddypress-bbpress-and-woocommerce\">Powefull integrations with BuddyPress, bbPress and WooCommerce<\/h2>\nMagellan supports integrations with the leading WordPress plugins. We have specifically styled WooCommerce, BuddyPress and bbPress to fit well with the theme. Now you can easily use forums, use BuddyPress social features or setup your storefront with WooCommerce\n\n\n<h2 id=\"item-description__changelog\">Changelog<\/h2>\n<pre>\nv.1.0.5 - September 9th;\n* Updated Visual Composer;\n* Fixed issue with review meta data;\n* Other minor bug fixes and improvements;\nv.1.0.4 - July 22nd;\n* Added option to auto slide homepage slider\n* Other minor bug fixes and improvements;\nv1.0.3 - July 4th;\n* Updated bundled Revolution Slider;\n* Other minor bug fixes and improvements;\nv1.0.2 - June 15th;\n* Imporoved demo import and intial install process;\n* Updated bundled Revolution Slider and Magellan Theme Extension plugins;\n* Other minor bug fixes and improvements;\nv1.0.1 - June 10th;\n* Fixed and issue with demo import;\n* Updated bundled Visual Composer plugin;\n* Imporoved mobile device support for lightboxes;\n* Other minor bug fixes and improvements\n<\/pre>\n\n<h2 id=\"item-description__help-and-support\">Help and Support<\/h2>\nIf you need help with this theme, please visit our <a href=\"http:\/\/planetshine.net\/support\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>support forum<\/strong><\/a>.
